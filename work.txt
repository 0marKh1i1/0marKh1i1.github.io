## Overview

**Al Yasoufy AC** is an end-to-end accounting software designed to simplify and automate financial workflows for companies.
 Built from the ground up, it offers a modern, responsive interface and a robust RESTful API backend. Currently halfway through development, 
 the platform already supports core accounting features and demonstrates a strong foundation for scalability and security.

## Key Features

- **General Ledger & Double-Entry Accounting**: Implements standard accounting principles with fully balanced ledger entries for accurate financial tracking.
- **Invoice Creation & Management**: Generate, send, and track invoices with customizable templates and automated reminders.
- **Real-Time Financial Dashboard**: Interactive charts and summaries provide at-a-glance insights into cash flow, expenses, and revenue trends.
- **Multi-Company & Role-Based Access**: Support for multiple entities within a single account, with granular permissions to control user access and actions.
- **Reporting & Export**: Export financial statements (e.g., balance sheet, income statement) in PDF or CSV formats for audits and compliance.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS library for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Django & DRF**: Backend framework and Django REST Framework for creating a scalable, secure RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database system ensuring ACID compliance and reliable data storage.
- **Context API**: React’s Context API for global state management across the application.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was optimizing the data flow between client and server to minimize latency under heavy load. 
Implementing efficient pagination and query optimization in DRF helped address performance bottlenecks. 
Balancing a flexible UI design with consistent data validation rules required clear contracts between frontend components and API endpoints. 
Additionally, configuring Django’s authentication and permissions system to support multi-company scenarios taught valuable lessons in fine-grained access control.

## Outcome

The project is now at the midpoint of its development cycle, with core features functional and an intuitive demo available. 
Early testing has shown significant improvements in speed and usability compared to legacy spreadsheets. Moving forward, 
further enhancements—such as two-factor authentication, third-party integrations, and advanced analytics—will solidify **Al Yasoufy AC** as a scalable solution for enterprise accounting needs.

## Overview

**ASTRO-IMPACT** is a demo website that helps people understand and witness first-hand the portrayal of one of the most serious and undermined very real threats to human civilization: collision with an asteroid. This website achieves that by putting the parameters of a hypothetical asteroid in the hands of the user to test and see the reality of what threats these objects truly pose once they impact Earth.

Impact side effects are made visible and digestible for a wide range of people, including estimated death toll, danger zones of effects like 3rd degree and 2nd degree burns, shockwave propagation, and seismic estimations. With both a "tame" mode and a professional mode, the message can be understood by everyone.

Alongside the actual simulation is a basic guide of mitigative actions that could be executed to minimize the world-altering damage such an event could cause. This project hopes to put more and more people into the right frame of mind relative to this very serious threat to our civilization, and therefore spark the necessary actions to prepare for it.

**Live Project**: [astro-impact.earth](https://astro-impact.earth)

## Key Features

- **Realistic Physics Engine**: Web Worker-based simulations calculate atmospheric entry, crater formation, fireball radius, shockwave propagation, and casualty estimates
- **NASA Integration**: Uses real asteroid data from NASA's Near Earth Object database
- **Two Modes**: 
  - Quick-start Real Mode (5 predefined asteroids × 6 countries)
  - Advanced Mode (full parameter control)
- **Educational Focus**: Pre/post-simulation modals teach about planetary defense strategies (NASA DART, gravity tractors, nuclear deflection)
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time animated meteor descent with adjustable speed (0.1x-250x) and intelligent camera systems
- **Interactive 3D Globe**: Built with CesiumJS for realistic Earth visualization and impact location selection

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: Modern frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for better code quality and maintainability
- **CesiumJS & Resium**: 3D globe visualization and geospatial rendering
- **GLB 3D Models**: Realistic 3D asteroid models
- **NASA APIs**: Real asteroid data integration

## Impact & Purpose

This tool aims to raise awareness about planetary defense, educate the public about asteroid threats, and demonstrate that impacts are preventable with proper preparation. It serves students, educators, and policymakers with scientifically accurate, accessible impact modeling.

By making complex scientific data interactive and visual, ASTRO IMPACT bridges the gap between academic research and public understanding, fostering informed discussions about one of humanity's most significant existential risks.
